# Real-world-end-to-end-ML-deployment-workflow-project
Build, evaluate, and deploy multiple machine learning classification models on a real-world dataset. This project involves comparing the performance of traditional machine learning models and ensemble methods using standard evaluation metrics, and deploying the trained models using an interactive Streamlit web application.
